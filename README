Some tools to extract data from Wikipedia database dump files or databases.


WARNING
-------
These scripts were quick and dirty solutions to some tasks I had to perform.
They are not shiny, finished products.
No warranty whatsoever.
Some paths/databases names, etc. may have to adapted.

GETTING THE DATA
----------------
You can download the Wikipedia dumps (and dumps of other Wikimedia projects)
from http://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html

EXTRACTING DATA
---------------
Some scripts expect the data to be in a MySQL database.
Use mwimport.pl (warning: it may be outdated), Google, and common sense to
load the dunp into your database.

I also highly recommend to look around for other extraction tools for Wikipedia
data. They may be better suited to whatever you need than the scripts in this
repository.
